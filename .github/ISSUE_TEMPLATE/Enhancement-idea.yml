        Purpose of the enhancement - if it solves some problem, precise in particular which. If it benefits the program in some other way, precise in particular why.
        Present the underlying reason why this enhancement makes sense, and what is the context of it.
      placeholder: |
        As of today ASF offers variety of beverages, such as latte macchiato or cappuccino. I'd appreciate if ASF offered some no-milk options as well, for example espresso or ristretto.
        I believe it'd further improve the program offering the users wider selection, which is very convenient.

        Simply add an option to brew some no-milk types of coffee. The existing logic is fine, we just need wider choice!

        I'm allergic to milk, there is currently no option to pick a beverage that doesn't include it.
        Temporarily I'm switching cup mid-brewing as a workaround, but that is suboptimal considering the milk wasted.
