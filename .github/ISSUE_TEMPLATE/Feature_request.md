<!--
I fully read and understood contributing guidelines of ASF available under https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md and I believe that my issue is valid - it requires a response from ASF development team, and not ASF support.

I understand that if my issue is not meeting contributing guidelines specified above, especially if it's a question or technical issue that is not related to ASF development in any way, then it will be closed and left unanswered.

### Why currently available solutions are not sufficient?

<!-- If something you're suggesting is already possible, then explain to us why currently available solutions are not sufficient. If it's not possible yet, then explain to us why it should be. -->

### Does your suggestion fall into ASF scope?

<!-- Is ASF really the proper tool to include your enhancement in the first place? Is it connected with idling Steam cards? -->

### Is your suggestion abiding to Steam guidelines?

<!-- If not, it will not be considered. Please make sure that you're not suggesting anything potentially unwanted, botting Steam Market is just a single example of such thing - https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement / https://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct -->
