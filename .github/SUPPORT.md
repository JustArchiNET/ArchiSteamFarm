# Support

Our **[wiki](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki)** is the official online documentation which covers at least a significant majority (if not all) of ASF subjects you could be interested in. We recommend to start with **[setting up](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Setting-up)**, **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** and our **[FAQ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ)** which should help you with setting up ASF, configuring it, as well as answering the most common questions that you might have. For more advanced matters, as well as further elaboration, we have other pages available on our **[wiki](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki)** that you can visit.

We also have three independent support channels dedicated to our ASF users, in case you couldn't manage to solve the issue yourself. We answer all support and technical matters in our **[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/discussions/categories/support-english)**, **[Steam group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/archiasf/discussions/1)**, and on our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/hSQgt8j)**. You're free to use the support channel that matches your preferences, although keep in mind that you have a higher chance solving your issue on the GitHub or Steam, where we're doing our best to answer all questions that couldn't be answered by our community itself (as opposed to Discord server where we're not active 24/7 and therefore not always able to answer).

GitHub **issues** (unlike discussions), are being used solely for ASF development, especially in regards to bugs and enhancements. We have a very strict policy regarding that, as GitHub issues is **not** a general support channel, it's dedicated exclusively to ASF development and we're not answering common ASF matters there, as we have appropriate support channels (mentioned above) for that. Common matters include not only general questions or issues that are obviously related to program usage, but also users reporting "bugs" that are clearly considered intended behaviour coming for example (and mainly) from misconfiguration or lack of understanding how the program works. If you're not sure whether your matter relates to ASF development or not, especially if you're not sure if it's a bug or intended behaviour, we recommend to use a support channel instead, where we'll answer you in calm atmosphere and forward your matter as GitHub issue if deemed appropriate. Invalid GitHub issues will be closed immediately and won't be answered.
