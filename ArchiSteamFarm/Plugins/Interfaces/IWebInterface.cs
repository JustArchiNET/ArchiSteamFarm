///     Implementing this interface allows you to provide your own (custom) web interface files that will be exposed by standard ASF's IPC interface. In order to achieve that, you must include a directory with your web interface (html, css, js) files together with your plugin's DLL assembly, then specify path to it in <see cref="PhysicalPath" /> and finally the path under which you want to host those files in <see cref="WebPath" />.

	/// <summary>
	///     Specifies physical path to static WWW files provided by the plugin. Can be either relative to plugin's assembly location, or absolute. Default value of "www" assumes that you ship "www" directory together with your plugin's main DLL assembly, similar to ASF.
	/// </summary>
	string PhysicalPath => "www";

	/// <summary>
	///     Specifies web path (address) under which ASF should host your static WWW files in <see cref="PhysicalPath" /> directory. Default value of "/" allows you to override default ASF files and gives you full flexibility in your <see cref="PhysicalPath" /> directory. However, you can instead host your files under some other fixed location specified here, such as "/MyPlugin".
